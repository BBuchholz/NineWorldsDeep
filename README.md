# NineWorldsDeep

NineWorldsDeep is a node based ecosystem created with the intent of practicing and exploring interconnected disciplines.

It aims to achieve this through facilitating the storage and retrieval of "hyperlinkable", "taggable", "hashable" holonic fragments of creative and investigative works in progress.

All projects with the Nwd prefix are a part of this ecosystem (eg. NwdWarehouse, NwdSynergy, NwdImageBrowser, &c.)

I am currently aiming to pull all of the separate projects into this main one, as various issues such as .dll conflicts occasionally creep up and valuable time is wasted maintaining so many different code bases. The major focus is functionality, so the projects remain divided for now, but the eventual goal is unification.
